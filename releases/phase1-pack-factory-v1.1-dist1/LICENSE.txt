DOCTRINE HASH BINDING (INTEGRITY REQUIREMENT)

licensed artifacts must comply with.

BOUND_DOCTRINE_DOCUMENT: OBSERVER_DOCTRINE.md

BOUND_DOCTRINE_HASH: e59dc19d68c2f73e83f734cb521047cff128015e913fe040b571c515974b0a03

Any copy, distribution, or use of artifacts under this license MUST retain:

1. The bound hash above
2. Access to the exact matching contents of OBSERVER_DOCTRINE.md

If the doctrine changes, a new license version MUST be published with a new
bound hash.

NO WARRANTY

Licensed artifacts are provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. The
